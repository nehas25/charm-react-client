# Charm - React project

A clothing store application, developed using React. This was my capstone project for Software Engineering Immersive coding bootcamp at General Assembly. Features:

- browse dresses
- add item to your shopping bag 
- delete them from bag
- login (try credentials u/p: test/test)
- sign up

## Technologies Used

- MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node)
- Bootstrap
- CSS

Also learned about and implemented some React Hooks - useState, useEffect, useParams.

## Wireframes

Started out with drawing out wireframes and writing user stories.
